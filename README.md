## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I over structured this challenge as an attempt to put to use and practice my knowledge in React. I learned alot about passing State down to components and how to pass state up using props. Although I would try to not do this on a normal basis, with the structuring I used, it was necessary to get the functionality required to complete the challenge.

### Continued development

I want to continue using React and Tailwind for my projects and challenges. I will now be focusing on ensuring I have proper structure without adding complications to the project as to the best of my ability. TailwindCSS has become extremely valuable now that I have become accustomed to the uses and not becoming overwhelmend as easily as I was when first learning.
